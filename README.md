# NFL Injury Prediction and Risk Analysis System

A comprehensive machine learning project analyzing NFL player injury patterns to predict injury risk and identify contributing factors for enhanced player safety decisions.

## Project Overview

This capstone project develops predictive models to analyze NFL player injury patterns using advanced machine learning techniques and three comprehensive datasets. The system achieves **97%+ accuracy** in predicting injury outcomes while providing actionable insights for injury prevention strategies.

## Key Objectives

- **Injury Risk Prediction**: Develop models to predict injury occurrence and recovery time (1-day, 7-day, 28-day, 42-day outcomes)
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Identify environmental, positional, and gameplay factors that increase injury susceptibility  
- **Pattern Recognition**: Analyze player movement patterns and their relationship to injury risk
- **Decision Support**: Provide evidence-based recommendations for injury prevention strategies

## Datasets

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **NFL Playing Surface Analytics** | Injury records, environmental conditions, player tracking data |
| **NFL Big Data Bowl 2023** | Advanced player movement tracking and game statistics |
| **NFL Punt Analytics Competition** | Specialized punt play analysis and injury data |

## Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Models
- **Supervised Learning**: Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means clustering, DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering
- **Deep Learning**: LSTM networks for sequential movement pattern analysis
- **Ensemble Methods**: XGBoost, AdaBoost, Extra Trees

### Technology Stack

## Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | AUC Score | Key Strengths |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Random Forest** | 97.35% | 0.989 | Feature importance, interpretability |
| **SVM (RBF)** | 95.36% | 0.992 | Non-linear pattern recognition |
| **Gradient Boosting** | 97.02% | 0.987 | Complex interaction modeling |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors** | 95.36% | 0.953 | Similarity-based predictions |

## Key Findings

- **Environmental Impact**: Temperature emerged as the strongest predictor across all models
- **Position-Specific Risk**: Tight Ends and Linebackers show elevated injury risk patterns
- **Surface Effects**: Synthetic surfaces associated with significantly higher injury rates
- **Movement Patterns**: Four distinct player movement clusters with varying injury risk profiles

## Business Impact
